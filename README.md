Project Overview

This project analyzes data from the Citi Bike program of 2023 to provide city officials with insights into the usage patterns of the bike-sharing service. By examining factors such as peak usage times, trip durations, and station popularity, this analysis aims to inform decisions to improve program efficiency and meet rider demand.

The analysis covers multiple aspects of Citi Bike usage over selected months in 2023, including seasonal trends and user behavior differences. The visualizations and dashboards created are saved on Tableau Public, making it easy for stakeholders to access the insights.

Visualizations

1. Peak Day of the Week
   ![Peak day in a week](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293372d5-bfd6-4a8e-a931-bbbbe5afeaaf)

Description: This bar chart shows the record count of rides for each day of the week, filtered to summer time. The visualization highlights the peak day for Citi Bike usage within a typical week.
Insight: Wednesday and Thursday have the highest ride counts, indicating mid-week is the peak period for bike usage.
2. Peak Hours in Summer and Winter
![Peak hours analyze](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad6d5c9d-91f0-4c2e-9744-98742da11d78)

Description: This dual bar chart compares the peak hours for Citi Bike usage during summer and winter times. The summer peak hours (8 AM and 5-6 PM) align with commuting times, while winter peak hours are more concentrated in the early evening.
Insight: Commuting patterns play a significant role in bike usage, with more balanced usage in summer and an early evening peak in winter.
3. Percentage Change in Monthly Usage
![percentage change](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bd3a5c9-3005-42f3-9ae0-288df9572cd1)

Description: This horizontal bar chart displays the percentage change in record counts by month, highlighting fluctuations in ridership across different times of the year.
Insight: Significant drops are observed in October through December, potentially due to colder weather impacting rider frequency.
4. Summer Peak Hours
Description: This chart shows peak hours for Citi Bike usage during the summer months, focusing on the times with the highest activity.
Insight: Peak times are concentrated around morning and evening commutes, suggesting high usage by workers and commuters.
6. Top 10 Stations for Ending a Journey
![TopTenStation-end](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70ba20cd-9464-45fa-b663-cc54866fed61)

Description: A bar chart listing the top 10 stations where rides are most frequently ended. This helps identify popular destinations within the Citi Bike network.
Insight: Stations like Grove St PATH and Hoboken Terminal are among the most popular endpoints, likely due to their proximity to transit hubs.
7. Top 10 Stations for Starting a Journey
![TopTenStation-start](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87643882-e933-46f7-95fe-2d29fcd2fbe0)

Description: This bar chart shows the top 10 starting stations, giving insight into the most popular locations for beginning a journey.
Insight: Similar to the top destinations, the starting stations indicate that riders frequently begin trips near transit centers.
8. Trip Duration Analysis by Bike Type and User Type
![Trip Duration anlyze](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50c2cbe0-085f-4d62-90e4-209fca8d8cae)

Description: A pair of bar charts comparing trip durations by bike type (classic, electric, docked) and by user type (casual and member).
Insight: Classic bikes are used for the longest cumulative trip durations, while electric bikes see higher duration averages. Members have longer average trip durations than casual users.


Dashboards
Two dashboards were created to capture different phenomena:

Seasonal Usage Dashboard: This dashboard focuses on the differences between summer and winter usage, showing peak hours and popular days.
Station Popularity Dashboard: Highlights the top stations for starting and ending trips, helping officials understand where infrastructure investments may be most beneficial.
Story
A Tableau Story was developed to guide city officials through the key insights from the analysis. It brings together visualizations and dashboards in a logical sequence, helping non-technical users understand the findings and their implications.
